Hashmap is the datastructure that implements the associative abstract datatypes, a structure that can map key to values.
Hash Table: It is just the arrays with function (hash function)

so here comes the hash function which is responsible for data storing from input and outputing data

Collision: woccur when two or more keys hash to the same index in the table.
 for example :  apple and ant

Collision resolution techniques:
To minimize collision,there are two methods:

1.linear Probing:    new value will be added in the open slot
  (has a look up time complexity if O(n))

2.Seperate chaining: uses linked list 
( each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list of entries that hash to the same index.
 When a collision occurs, the colliding elements are stored in the linked list.)

Dictionary: It is the hash table representation in python which is a ordered key:value paired datastructure.
It's syntax:

dict = {key1:value1,
        key2:value2,
        key3:value3,
        ....
        keyn:valuen
        }

It is mutable and can contain values wiht multiple multiple datatypes.
Although Dictionary is mutable, key is immutable and unique.
